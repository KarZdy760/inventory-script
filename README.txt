Hello,

I wrote this script to automate a little bit process of the inventory in my company. It automatically
retrieves computer data like serialnumber and so on, and also allows users to enter their own data like first name, lastname, department
where they work then write it to an excel file. This script is eliminating the need for manual checking computer data on each computer.

(excel file was located on  the global drive, giving everyone in our network possibility to contribute their data to the excel using script)
